The Great British Public Toilet Map was created by <a href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/helen-hamlyn-centre/"><strong>The Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design</strong></a> at the Royal College of Art. It was designed and built by<a href="http://www.neontribe.co.uk"> </a><a href="http://www.neontribe.co.uk"><strong>Neontribe</strong></a>. It is funded by the <a href="http://www.nominettrust.org.uk"><strong>Nominet Trust</strong></a>. It began as part of the TACT3 research project, funded by the New Dynamics of Ageing programme.

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
    The map shows toilets that the public can use. This includes those in shops, cafes etc if they choose to let non-customers use their loo, such as those in
    Community Toilet Schemes. We try not to include those that are for customer use only.
</p>
<p>
    The data comes from councils, businesses, the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> project and YOU! The data will be available for
    others to use under an open licence.
</p>
<p>
    Please help by adding and editing toilets.
</p>
<h3>Info for councils</h3>
<p>
    The Local Government Association manage a scheme to help councils to publish ‘open data’ about public toilets, planning applications and licensing of
    premises. Councils are paid £7000 if they publish all three datasets as part of Local Open Data Incentive Scheme.
